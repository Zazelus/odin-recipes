        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
            <p>
                Risotto is like a clingy baby. You can’t put it down, you can’t walk away from it, 
                and you can’t ignore it. Its needs are simple, it just wants all of you. And if you 
                give it all of your patient attention, it will turn into a puddle of love. This 
                simple, pure, unadulterated version stands up on its own, but it also makes an 
                excellent canvas for seasonal ingredients—find out more about those toppings at the 
                very end of the recipe.

                <li>Add 1/2 cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and completely tender, about 5 minutes.</li>

                <li>Add rice and stir well to coat with oil. Stir constantly until grains of rice are translucent around the edges and make a clattering sound when hitting the sides and bottom of pot. Around 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is completely evaporated, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium and add hot salted water to rice in 3/4-cup incredments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to fully abosrb before adding more.</li>
                <li>Repeat until rice is tender and surrounded by fluid, not too thick. About 25-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Start checking rice after about 15 minutes, grains should be tender but not mushy. Do not overcook!</li>
                <li>Remove pot from heat, add butter and stir until melted.</li>
                <li>Gradually add 1/4 cups Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid surrounding risotto is creamy but very fluid.</li>
                <li>Stir in more hot salted water if needed for the right consistency. Taste and season with salt if needed.</li>
                <li>Divide risotto among warm bowls. Top each with a grind of pepper. Serve with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan alongside for passing.</li>
