Introduction

Just a small project to refresh and practice my HTML, it's a simple website consisting of links to a few recipes. Made only with HTML, this is not the best example of a modern website in terms of design or interactivity.

Credits:

The recipes were not written by me, I have included links to the following:

Lasagna: https://www.thespruceeats.com/white-and-red-sauce-lasagna-recipe-995925

Couscous: https://www.cookingclassy.com/lemon-couscous-recipe/

Risotto: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-risotto

The images were also taken from each link respectively, enjoy!
